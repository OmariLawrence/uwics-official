# About Page
## General Information

This page was designed to give the user more information about the club in general. 
It may be useful for existing club members to discover something new about the club and it gives
outsiders a snapshot of what the club is really like. 

Useful information include: 
* The history of the club
* Some points about how we run our sessions
* Common events that we host
* Morals and Values of the club

## Developer Information
This page, just like all other pages, belongs to a lazy loaded module. Due to this page being relatively text-heavy, care should be 
taken not to overwhelm the user with all the information at once. Design changes may need 
to take place in the future. 

Dependencies:
* SharedModule

Components:
* MainPageComponent
* AboutCardComponent
